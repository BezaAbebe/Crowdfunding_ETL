# Crowdfunding_ETL - Project 2

## Project Overview/Objectives
This project aims to demonstrate the construction of an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas for processing crowdfunding data. Our objectives include data extraction from Excel, transformation of data into structured formats, and loading the structured data into a PostgreSQL database.

## Team members:
